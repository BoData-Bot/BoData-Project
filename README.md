# BoData-Project

### How might we measure what people purchase in emerging market groceries or bodegas that lack electronic POS equipment?

Traditional trade accounts for over 60% of retail sales in emerging markets and is extremely challenging to track. Our goal is to improve the lives of traditional trade merchants in emerging markets by collecting purchase level data and providing a solution that will either improve efficiency or help grow their business for free. Profitability would be achieved by selling the same data to large MNC's to improve their production planning through these consumption insights.
